## Capstone Experiences {.unnumbered}

### Can I complete more than one [capstone](02-tracks.qmd) experience? {.unnumbered}

Typically, it is only possible to complete one capstone experience. An exceptions to this would be if a student completed the [Sandbox](02-tracks.qmd#sandbox) program their sophomore year before entering the strategy major.

## Course Subsitutions {.unnumbered}

### Can I substitute other courses for my electives? {.unnumbered}

In general no but expections may be granted with good justification for why the requested substitute course makes sense. Petitions for a subsitution may be submitted to [Lisa Giguere](mailto:lisa_giguere@byu.edu).

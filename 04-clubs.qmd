## Sponsored Clubs {.unnumbered}

The Strategic Management program sponsors four [clubs](https://clubs.byu.edu/) that help prepare students not only for admission to the program careers as well.

It's not expected that a student would attend all of these clubs, but students interested in admission should plan to explore the clubs and see if there's one that they have particular interest in. 

### Strategy Society {.unnumbered}

The Strategy Society is led by a student leadership team who leads program wide events and initiatives. The strategy society presidency is also your first point of contact if you have questions about the program and whether it would be a good fit.

### [Management Consulting Association (MCA)](https://www.byumca.com/) {.unnumbered}

Management consultants are elite problem-solvers, hired by companies to address complex business challenges and opportunities. By using a combination of structured thinking, analytical skills, and clear communication, consultants are able to assist primary decision-makers across a variety of industries in both the public and private sector.

The MCA will prepare you for the real-world business world, with meetings run by students advanced in the consulting recruiting process, guest speakers who successfully navigated the consulting recruiting process, and trainings on interview best-practices, networking etiquette, and resume reviews.

The MCA is run by BYU students who have gone through the interview process and landed offers at the top consulting firms. The purpose of the MCA is to help you prepare to do the same! As a member of the MCA, you'll be surrounded by other high-performing and high-potential students in the Marriott school from all stages of the consulting preparation process who will become case practice partners and lifelong friends.

Once an official member of the MCA, you will have access to a library of casing resources, including full case books and casing instructions, an essential portion of the recruiting process at any of the top consulting firms.

MCA Meetings are **every Tuesday at 7pm** in the Tanner building throughout the Fall and Winter semesters.

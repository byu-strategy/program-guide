## Introduction {.unnumbered}

This guide is intended as an information resource for prospective and current students as well as employers and others interested in learning about the Strategic Management major at BYU.

The Strategic Management program at BYU helps students develop the skills needed to improve organizational performance by solving complex business problems and capitalizing on new opportunities. Doing so requires both hard technical skills (e.g. coding, data analysis, financial modeling) and soft people skills (e.g. influencing others through storytelling, developing trust, and working in teams).

Because of the necessity for both hard and soft skills the Strategy program seeks to attract students with high leadership potential who practice genuine curiosity, work well with others, are analytically rigorous, and driven.

## What is Strategy? {.unnumbered}

The field of strategy, also called strategic management, is a discipline within business and management studies that focuses on how organizations create, deliver, and capture value to achieve long-term success. It deals with how firms make decisions about their goals, allocate resources, respond to competition, and adapt to changing environments.

The core questions in strategy are:

-   In what markets should we compete? (e.g., industries, geographies, customer segments)
-   What is the unique value we will offer? (e.g., lower costs, differentiated product features)
-   What capabilities and resources are necessary for us to be successful? (e.g., specialized skills, brand, culture)
-   How can we sustain our competitive advantage to build a durable business? (e.g., barriers to imitation, network effects)

These are complex, ambiguous, and high-stakes questions requiring the integration of knowledge spanning finance, marketing, operations, economics, and technology. Because of this complexity, the opportunity to major in strategy at the undergraduate level is very rare and almost always reserved for MBA and PhD level education. Indeed, BYU has one of the only Strategic Management undergraduate majors anywhere in the world.

Why do we believe undergraduates at BYU are ready to study strategy when most institutions reserve it for graduate students? Simply put, BYU students are unlike any others. Many have already:

-   Served missions that required leadership, cross-cultural communication, and long-term planning
-   Worked in meaningful jobs or started businesses
-   Learned a second language and lived abroad
-   Married and taken on family responsibilities

BYU students are mission-driven individuals who routinely engage with big, life-shaping decisions. This maturity, combined with their intellectual rigor and values-based foundation, equips them to think strategicallyâ€”grappling with ambiguity, balancing tradeoffs, and solving complex problems.

## What do we look for in applicants? {.unnumbered}

A metaphor for the kind of student that will thrive in the Strategy program is that of a CEO-Janitor.

The CEO-Janitor is someone who takes ownership like a CEO by solving hard problems, making strategic decisions, and leading with vision but is also willing to roll up their sleeves like a janitor to do whatever the team needs, no task too small or beneath them. This mindset captures the kind of low-ego, high-capacity leader the Strategy program seeks to cultivate: driven, curious, collaborative, and unafraid of sometimes messy work.

The program is not the best fit for students who prefer highly scripted environments or are not comfortable navigating between big picture thinking and nitty gritty execution.

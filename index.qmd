## Introduction {.unnumbered}

This guide is intended as an information resource for prospective and current students as well as employers and others interested in learning about the Strategic Management major at BYU.

The Strategic Management program at BYU helps students develop the skills needed to improve organizational performance by solving complex business problems and capitalizing on new opportunities. Doing so requires both hard technical skills (e.g. coding, data analysis, financial modeling) and soft people skills (e.g. influencing others through storytelling, developing trust, and working in teams).

Because of the necessity for both hard and soft skills the Strategy program seeks to attract students with high leadership potential who practice genuine curiosity, work well with others, are analytically rigorous, and driven.

## What we look for in applicants {.unnumbered}

A metaphor for the kind of student that will thrive in the Strategy program is that of a CEO-Janitor.

The CEO-Janitor is someone who takes ownership like a CEO by solving hard problems, making strategic decisions, and leading with vision but is also willing to roll up their sleeves like a janitor to do whatever the team needs, no task too small or beneath them. This mindset captures the kind of low-ego, high-capacity leader the Strategy program seeks to cultivate: driven, curious, collaborative, and unafraid of sometimes messy work.

The program is not the best fit for students who prefer highly scripted environments or are not comfortable navigating between big picture thinking and nitty gritty execution.

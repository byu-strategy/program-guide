## Summary {.unnumbered}

The Strategic Management program at BYU helps students develop the
skills needed to improve organizational performance by solving complex
business problems and capitalizing on new opportunities. Doing so
requires both hard technical skills (e.g. coding, data analysis,
financial modeling) and soft people skills (e.g. influencing others
through storytelling, developing trust, and working in teams).

Because of the necessity for both hard and soft skills the Strategy
program seeks to attract students with high leadership potential who
practice genuine curiosity, work well with others, are analytically
rigorous, and driven.

## Curriculum {.unnumbered}

Strategy students engage with a challenging curriculum that teaches them
how to organize and structure available information, then articulate
clear, logical decisions based on it.

In doing this, students will:

- Engage in [case study based classroom
  discussions](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/the-case-method)

- Gather, analyze, and articulate insights from real world data using
  Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau

- Prepare and present CEO quality slide decks containing evidence-based
  recommendations

- Gain proficiency with the latest AI tools

- Learn foundational economic theory and strategy frameworks to guide their thinking

- Complete a capstone project for a real company where they either:

  - Analyze a real company's strategy and present tailored
    recommendations to it's leadership
    
  - Build a real physical or digital product from scratch (via
    [Sandbox](https://creators.byu.edu/sandbox/sandbox) or [Crocker
    Innovation Fellowship)](https://crockerinnovationfellows.com/), or
    complete a Product Mangement internship with a leading company.


## Career outcomes {.unnumbered}

Strategy students graduate with a strong track record of placement in
consulting, corporate strategy, and product management roles. The major
consistently achieves [**100%
placement**](https://byu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/murff_byu_edu/EVe5md0DtNhOrolfnGxg6fQB1F75peFtvGgYqT2rEkYJAg?e=J8Qt0U),
with the **highest average starting salary in the Marriott School
(\$83,000).**

other top consulting
firms](https://byu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/murff_byu_edu/EXAQsKD1LS5Pm8VckCiUU4gBE9NLnEU2Oieu1exM-GKkUA?e=BxObQe)**.

## What we look for in applicants {.unnumbered}

Students who thrive in Strategy tend to be multi-dimensional: strong
academically, good communicators, naturally curious, collaborative with
others, and logical thinkers.

The program is not the best fit for students who prefer highly scripted
and formulaic environments or curriculum.

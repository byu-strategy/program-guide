## Consulting {.unnumbered}

Management Consulting offers students the opportunity to work with leading firms solving complex business challenges across a wide range of industries. Consultants serve as trusted advisorsâ€”analyzing problems, designing solutions, and supporting implementation to drive organizational success.

BYU students who have served missions are uniquely prepared for a consulting because of several key characteristics shared between consulting and missionary service:

- Working with senior leaders â€“ Consultants often collaborate with senior clients, much like missionaries engage with ward councils composed of seasoned Church members and leaders.
- Close knit team collaboration â€“ Consultants typically work in small teams, building strong bonds and spending significant time together, similar to the companionship dynamic on a mission.
- Project-based structure â€“ Consulting projects often last six weeks to six months before transitioning to a new client or project which mirrors how missionaries rotate through different areas.

The ability to quickly build trust and rapport with a broad range of stakeholders is an essential skill for success in both missions and consulting.

The work hours and lifestyle of a consultant can vary widely, depending on the firm and the project. While there are certainly quieter moments, in general it is considered a rigorous and intense profession. McKinsey is famous for using the phrase that working there is "more than a job but less than a life." That being said, many Latter-day Saints have  successful careers in consulting and are able to set appropriate boundaries to thrive professionally, in their families, and in church service. 

Relatively high turnover is common in the field of consulting with many new graduates spending 2 to 3 years working then pursuing an MBA, return to their consulting firm for two additional years and then exit to a corporate strategy type role. 

Others exit directly after 2 to 3 years into other great corporate jobs or start their own companies.

Working in consulting has been compared to doing a medical residency. It can be a period of intensity in your career but lead to great future opportunities.

The BYU Stategy program has of one of the best consulting preparation curriculums anywhere in the country. Several of our faculty have worked as management consultants and infuse this experience throughout the program and the curriculum.

Through a partnership with Management Consulted we are pleased to offer our students access to the industry's premier consulting preparation knowledge base and platform.

## Corporate Strategy {.unnumbered}

A career in corporate strategy places students inside major companies where they help shape long-term business direction, analyze competitive positioning, and drive growth initiatives. Strategy professionals work closely with senior leadership to make data-driven decisions on market entry, M&A, and innovation. Itâ€™s an ideal path for those who enjoy solving strategic puzzles from within a company and want to influence its trajectory from the inside out.

## Product Management {.unnumbered}

Product managers (PMs) are at the heart of technology and innovation, acting as the bridge between customer needs, business goals, and engineering capabilities. They lead cross-functional teams to discover, develop, and deliver products that users love and businesses value. Strategy students bring strong problem-solving, prioritization, and customer-centric thinking to this fast-paced and impactful career.

## Entrepreurship {.unnumbered}

Entrepreneurship allows students to turn ideas into ventures, whether by founding startups, joining early-stage teams, or launching within established companies. It requires vision, grit, and a deep understanding of markets, customers, and value creation. Strategy students are equipped with frameworks and experience to navigate uncertainty and build businesses that scale.

## Academia {.unnumbered}

A career as a professor in academia enables students to contribute to the world of ideasâ€”through research, teaching, and thought leadership. It demands curiosity, rigor, and the ability to frame and investigate complex questions. Strategy students who pursue the Research track gain the analytical tools, writing skills, and intellectual discipline to pursue graduate studies or academic careers, advancing knowledge that shapes organizations and society.

## Other Career Paths {.unnumbered}

Strategy students pursue a wide range of paths beyond these traditional roles, including roles in private equity, venture capital, social impact, policy, business development, and general management. The analytical rigor and strategic mindset developed in the program prepare students to thrive in any setting where critical thinking and smart execution are valued.

\section*{Summary}\label{summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Summary}

\markright{Summary}

The Strategic Management program at BYU helps students develop the
skills needed to improve organizational performance by solving complex
business problems and capitalizing on new opportunities. Doing so
requires both hard technical skills (e.g.~coding, data analysis,
financial modeling) and soft people skills (e.g.~influencing others
through storytelling, developing trust, and working in teams).

Because of the necessity for both hard and soft skills the Strategy
program seeks to attract students with high leadership potential who
practice genuine curiosity, work well with others, are analytically
rigorous, and driven.

\section*{Curriculum}\label{curriculum}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Curriculum}

\markright{Curriculum}

Strategy students engage with a challenging curriculum that teaches them
how to organize and structure available information, then articulate
clear, logical decisions based on it.

In doing this, students will:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Engage in
  \href{https://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/the-case-method}{case
  study based classroom discussions}
\item
  Gather, analyze, and articulate insights from real world data using
  Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau
\item
  Prepare and present CEO quality slide decks containing evidence-based
  recommendations
\item
  Gain proficiency with the latest AI tools
\item
  Learn foundational economic theory and strategy frameworks to guide
  their thinking
\item
  Complete a capstone project for a real company where they either:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Analyze a real company's strategy and present tailored
    recommendations to it's leadership
  \item
    Build a real physical or digital product from scratch (via
    \href{https://creators.byu.edu/sandbox/sandbox}{Sandbox} or
    \href{https://crockerinnovationfellows.com/}{Crocker Innovation
    Fellowship)}, or complete a Product Mangement internship with a
    leading company.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Career outcomes}\label{career-outcomes}

Strategy students graduate with a strong track record of placement in
consulting, corporate strategy, and product management roles. The major
consistently achieves

Marriott School (\$83,000).}

\section*{What we look for in
applicants}\label{what-we-look-for-in-applicants}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{What we look for in applicants}

\markright{What we look for in applicants}

Students who thrive in Strategy tend to be multi-dimensional: strong
academically, good communicators, naturally curious, collaborative with
others, and logical thinkers.

The program is not the best fit for students who prefer highly scripted
and formulaic environments or curriculum.

\subsection*{Case preparation}\label{case-preparation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Case preparation}

Your application will include responding to a case question. Answering a
case question is a type of simulation that explores how would would
think through a real business problem. You're asked to analyze a
situation, structure your thinking, and recommend a course of action. It
tests how you break down complex problems, use data, and communicate
solutions clearly and logically while under a bit of time pressure. It's
less about getting the ``exact right answer'' and more about
demonstrating your approach to solving complex, ambiguous problems like
those faced in real life business situations.

You are strongly encouraged to practice several cases before you
complete your actual case interview.

Below you will find two types of case questions both of which will be
valuable to practice. The first two are past case questions from
strategy admissions and the remainder are example cases from McKinsey
and Company.

\href{https://byu-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/murff_byu_edu/EYJXiOSdEslHqYeG5AQBLCQB21i0E1blVlS48a0T_oNxMQ?e=IrkYKv}{2023
case qustion and solution}

\href{https://byu-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/murff_byu_edu/EY6gqE3YuhJBtc-IEHaNkbIBfsxePrwVqdYbLnxVnIS5dA?e=EeDaUA}{2024
case qustion and solution}

The McKinsey cases are designed for 20 to 30 minute interviews so will
be more involved than what you will have to answer in your application.
If you do well on the McKinsey practice cases, you will likely do well
on the strategy admission case.

    "text": "Introduction\nThis guide is intended as an informational resource for prospective and current students as well as employers and others interested in learning about the Strategic Management major at BYU.\nThe Strategic Management program at BYU helps students develop the skills needed to improve organizational performance by solving complex business problems and capitalizing on new opportunities. Doing so requires both hard technical skills (e.g. coding, data analysis, financial modeling) and soft people skills (e.g. influencing others through storytelling, developing trust, and working in teams).\nBecause of the necessity for both hard and soft skills, the Strategy program seeks to attract students with high leadership potential who practice genuine curiosity, work well with others, are analytically rigorous, and driven.",

    "text": "What is Strategy?\nThe field of strategy, also called strategic management, is a discipline within business and management studies that focuses on how organizations create, deliver, and capture value to achieve long-term success. It deals with how firms make decisions about their goals, allocate resources, respond to competition, and adapt to changing environments.\nThe core questions in strategy are:\n\nIn what markets should we compete? (e.g., industries, geographies, customer segments)\nWhat is the unique value we will offer? (e.g., lower costs, differentiated product features)\nWhat capabilities and resources are necessary for us to be successful? (e.g., specialized skills, brand, culture)\nHow can we sustain our competitive advantage to build a durable business? (e.g., barriers to imitation, network effects)\n\nThese are complex, ambiguous, and high-stakes questions requiring the integration of knowledge spanning finance, marketing, operations, economics, and technology. Because of this complexity, the opportunity to major in strategy at the undergraduate level is very rare and almost always reserved for MBA and PhD level education. Indeed, BYU has one of the only Strategic Management undergraduate majors anywhere in the world.\nWhy do we believe undergraduates at BYU are ready to study strategy when most institutions reserve it for graduate students? Simply put, BYU students are unlike any others. Many have already:\n\nServed volunteer missions for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that required leadership, cross-cultural communication, and long-term planning\nWorked in meaningful jobs or started businesses\nLearned a second language and lived abroad\nMarried and taken on family responsibilities\n\nBYU students are mission-driven individuals who routinely engage with big, life-shaping decisions. This maturity, combined with their intellectual rigor and values-based foundation, equips them to think strategically—grappling with ambiguity, balancing tradeoffs, and solving complex problems.",

This mindset captures the kind of low-ego, high-capacity leader the Strategy program seeks to cultivate: one who is driven, curious, collaborative, and unafraid of sometimes messy work.\nThe program is not the best fit for students who prefer highly scripted environments or are not comfortable navigating between big picture thinking and nitty gritty execution.",

    "text": "Management Consulting\nStrategy students may choose (but are not required) to follow one of four tracks. Each track guides your elective choices, provides a distinct experiential learning opportunity, and connects to likely career outcomes. All majors, regardless of track, complete the same Junior Core. Minors complete a slightly trimmed version of the Junior Core and may also choose to align with a track contingent on the associated courses working for their schedule.\nTracks are meant to help you select electives and understand the career paths a Strategy degree can lead to. You do not need to officially declare a track with the advisement office, and you may switch tracks at any time. However, if you are interested in the Product or Research tracks, it is best to decide soon after admission, as these require specific classes in your first semester to keep the option open.\nOriginally known as the Business Analyst track, the Management Consulting track has formed the foundation of BYU’s Strategy program since its inception in 2009. Founded by Jeff Dyer, a former Bain & Company consultant and internationally recognized expert in innovation and strategy, the Strategy major was initially designed to prepare BYU students for consulting positions at top-tier firms. While we continue this mission today, the program has expanded to offer multiple tracks that reflect the growing landscape of career opportunities in strategy.\nManagement consultants are external advisors to organizations that help them solve challenging business problems, improve performance, and implement strategic changes. Consultants bring specialized expertise, objective perspectives, and a structured problem-solving approach when companies are looking for support to address a particular problem effectively.\nDespite the disruption AI is causing throughout the economy and the impact of DOGE (see here and here), demand for management consultants remains high with estimated revenues of ~$400BN annually in the US. In fact, the AI disruption presents new opportunities for management consultants to add value to organizations addressing the effects of AI on their workforce and on their business.\nMcKinsey, Bain, and BCG (MBB) are the best known global consulting firms, however there is a long list of other excellent firms that you should consider. Because of the notoriety of the MBB firms, they receive an exceptionally high volume of applications, generally only hiring 1% of applicants.\nWhen firms are only hiring one percent of applicants, it becomes somewhat of a game of chance and the differentiation between great applicants is hard to discern. Hence, you should absolutely throw your hat in the ring for MBB firms, but also don’t get your heart too set and cast a wider net with other excellent even if lesser known firms.\nA complete list of leading consulting firms can be found here.\nSee Example Job Descriptions",

Corporate strategists operate at the intersection of analysis and execution, translating market insights and organizational capabilities into actionable strategic plans that drive business performance.\nCorporate strategy professionals are embedded within organizations as full-time employees, working closely with C-suite executives, business unit leaders, and cross-functional teams to identify opportunities, evaluate strategic options, and guide critical business decisions. Unlike external consultants, corporate strategists develop deep institutional knowledge and maintain long-term accountability for the outcomes of their recommendations, giving them unique insight into what actually works within their specific organizational context.\nCorporate strategy roles exist across virtually every industry, from Fortune 500 corporations to high-growth startups, each offering unique challenges and learning opportunities.\nCorporate strategists typically focus on areas such as market analysis, competitive intelligence, merger and acquisition evaluation, new business development, strategic planning, and performance improvement initiatives.\nMany corporate strategists also transition between internal roles and external consulting positions throughout their careers, leveraging the complementary skill sets developed in each environment.\nLeading companies known for strong corporate strategy functions include Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and many others across diverse industries.\nSee Example Job Descriptions",

Often described as “mini-CEOs” of their products, product managers are responsible for defining product vision, prioritizing features, and coordinating cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that create meaningful value for users and drive business growth.\nProduct managers work as internal leaders within organizations, collaborating closely with engineering, design, marketing, sales, and executive teams to guide product development from conception to launch and beyond. AI is allowing product managers to do more than ever before and be less reliant on engineering and design teams to decide what gets built.\nStudents who join the Product track complete 1 of 4 experiential learning experiences:\n\nAssociate Product Manager (APM) Internship: Students complete a 4-month product focused internship (unpaid) starting Winter of their junior year.\nAssociate Product Builder (APB) Fellowship: Students build and deliver to market a pre-validated product concept from the Strategy Foundry, starting Winter of their junior year.\nSandbox: Students build and launch a digital product from scratch starting in the summer after their junior year.\nCrocker Innovation Fellowship: Students design and build a physical product from scratch starting Winter of their junior year.\n\nThe Associate Product Manager (APM) Internship and the Associate Product Builder (APB) Fellowship are administered by the Strategy program. About 10-15 Strategy students participate in each experience each year.\nSandbox and the Crocker Innovation Fellowship are administered by the Entrepreneurship program and are subject to their own applications. Typically 5-10 Strategy students are admitted to Sandbox while 1-2 students are admitted to the Crocker Innovation Fellowship each year.\nIn total, 30-40 Strategy students typically join the Product track through 1 of these 4 experiences.\n\nAssociate Product Manager (APM) Internship\nStudents complete a 4-month product focused internship (unpaid) starting Winter of their junior year. Students work a minimum of 10 hours per week. Work may be in person or remote depending on the location and preferences of the company. Companies may offer to pay students for hours beyond 10 per week during the Winter semester. Any such paid arrangement is negotiated directly between the student and the company, however host companies have been informed this is an option they can discuss with you. Students should generally not work more than 20 hours per week to ensure they can give their other Junior Core classes proper attention.\nThe internship may extend into summer and convert to paid depending on negotiations between the company and the student.\nStudents interested in being considered should enroll during Fall of their junior in both:\n\nMSB 341: Product Management (cross listed as ENT 401: Entrepreneurial Innovation) (3.0 credits)\nMSB 342: Product Management Lecture Series (1.0 credit)\n\nIf your Junior Core schedule conflicts with enrolling in one or both of these courses, you may take STRAT 490R-001: Creating Digital Products with AI as an alternative in order to still be eligible for an APM internship.\nYou must take either MSB 341: Product Management (cross listed as ENT 401: Entrepreneurial Innovation) OR STRAT 490R-001: Creating Digital Products with AI to be eligible for an APM internship.\nMid-way through Fall semester, interested students will interview with both a faculty member and prospective companies to be matched to an APM internship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Product Builder (APB) Fellowship*\n*The APB experience is being explored and is not guaranteed to happen. Student may do the APM experience if not, with no classes wasted.\nRegister your interest here to stay informed on the APB opportunity.\nThe Associate Product Builder (APB) Fellowship is a 12-month experiential learning experience where students build and deliver to market a pre-validated product concept from the Strategy Foundry and seek to earn real revenue, starting Winter of their junior year. The experience is partly modeled after LinkedIn’s first-ever Associate Product Builder (APB) program.\n“We are entering a new era of building. And the full-stack builder archetype is arising with it. A full-stack builder is capable of developing experiences, combining skills & expertise, across traditionally distinct domains (e.g. design, product management, technology, business strategy).”\nTomer Cohen, Chief Product Officer at LinkedIn\n\nTeams of 3-5 students work on the business full-time over the Spring and Summer after their junior year and part-time (10-20 hours) in the Fall and Winter Semester of their senior year.\nParticipating students receive a stipend to cover their tuition during the Spring and Summer terms. Students with additional financial needs should speak with the program director.\nStudents receive a loan of between $1,000 and $5,000 to seed their business. Loans should be repaid by revenue generated over the following 12 months with a market interest rate. Re-paid dollars go back into the pool to fund future businesses and create a reserve. After the loan is repaid in full, students split any additional revenue after costs equally or may choose to reinvest it in the company. There is no credit impact to student’s credit profile if unpaid, however, effort towards loan repayment is considered as part of course grading.\nAt the completion of the 12-month experience, students wanting to continue working on the company who have repaid their loan can mutually agree on equity positions and take the company forward.\nIf students don’t desire to take the company forward, the idea and IP goes back to the Strategy Foundry or is wound down.\n\nStudents interested in being considered should enroll during Fall of their junior in both:\n\nSTRAT 490R - Creating Digital Products with AI: Strategy & Prototyping\nMSB 342: Product Management Lecture Series (1.0 credit)\n\n\n\nSandbox\nSandbox students spend two semesters working in a small team to build and launch launch a software tech business from scratch—one of the best experiences those interested in tech entrepreneurship or product management can get in school.\nIn April of each year students completing Sandbox have the opportunity to pitch what they’ve built to real investors.\nApplications for Sandbox are completed during Winter Semester.\nFollow on LinkedIn\nThere are no formal pre-reqs.\n\n\nCrocker Innovation Fellowship\nThe Crocker Innovation Fellowship is an interdisciplinary innovation program that runs from January to December each year. Students study and practice principles of innovation in Winter semester, learn through a summer internship, and then study and practice principles of innovation commercialization in the Fall semester. Interested students from all majors are encouraged to apply.\nApplications for the 2026 class will open Fall 2025.\nEmail crockerfellows@gmail.com with any questions.\nThere are no formal pre-reqs.",

Consultants serve as trusted advisors—analyzing problems, designing solutions, and supporting implementation to drive organizational success.\nBYU students who have served missions are uniquely prepared for a consulting because of several key characteristics shared between consulting and missionary service:\n\nWorking with senior leaders – Consultants often collaborate with senior clients, much like missionaries engage with ward councils composed of seasoned Church members and leaders.\nClose knit team collaboration – Consultants typically work in small teams, building strong bonds and spending significant time together, similar to the companionship dynamic on a mission.\nProject-based structure – Consulting projects often last six weeks to six months before transitioning to a new client or project which mirrors how missionaries rotate through different areas.\n\nThe ability to quickly build trust and rapport with a broad range of stakeholders is an essential skill for success in both missions and consulting.\nThe work hours and lifestyle of a consultant can vary widely, depending on the firm and the project. While there are certainly quieter moments, in general it is considered a rigorous and intense profession. McKinsey is famous for using the phrase that working there is “more than a job but less than a life.” That being said, many Latter-day Saints have successful careers in consulting and are able to set appropriate boundaries to thrive professionally, in their families, and in church service.\nRelatively high turnover is common in the field of consulting with many new graduates spending 2 to 3 years working then pursuing an MBA, return to their consulting firm for two additional years and then exit to a corporate strategy type role.\nOthers exit directly after 2 to 3 years into other great corporate jobs or start their own companies.\nWorking in consulting has been compared to doing a medical residency. It can be a period of intensity in your career but lead to great future opportunities.\nThe BYU Stategy program has of one of the best consulting preparation curriculums anywhere in the country. Several of our faculty have worked as management consultants and infuse this experience throughout the program and the curriculum.\nThrough a partnership with Management Consulted we are pleased to offer our students access to the industry’s premier consulting preparation knowledge base and platform.\nExplore Management Consulting Job Board",

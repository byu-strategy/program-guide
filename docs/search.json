Doing so requires both hard technical skills (e.g. coding, data analysis, financial modeling) and soft people skills (e.g. influencing others through storytelling, developing trust, and working in teams).\nBecause of the necessity for both hard and soft skills the Strategy program seeks to attract students with high leadership potential who practice genuine curiosity, work well with others, are analytically rigorous, and driven.",

    "text": "What is Strategy?\nThe field of strategy, also called strategic management, is a discipline within business and management studies that focuses on how organizations create, deliver, and capture value to achieve long-term success. It deals with how firms make decisions about their goals, allocate resources, respond to competition, and adapt to changing environments.\nThe core questions in strategy are:\n\nIn what markets should we compete? (e.g., industries, geographies, customer segments)\nWhat is the unique value we will offer? (e.g., lower costs, differentiated product features)\nWhat capabilities and resources are necessary for us to be successful? (e.g., specialized skills, brand, culture)\nHow can we sustain our competitive advantage to build a durable business? (e.g., barriers to imitation, network effects)\n\nThese are complex, ambiguous, and high-stakes questions requiring the integration of knowledge spanning finance, marketing, operations, economics, and technology. Because of this complexity, the opportunity to major in strategy at the undergraduate level is very rare and almost always reserved for MBA and PhD level education. Indeed, BYU has one of the only Strategic Management undergraduate majors anywhere in the world.\nWhy do we believe undergraduates at BYU are ready to study strategy when most institutions reserve it for graduate students? Simply put, BYU students are unlike any others. Many have already:\n\nServed missions that required leadership, cross-cultural communication, and long-term planning\nWorked in meaningful jobs or started businesses\nLearned a second language and lived abroad\nMarried and taken on family responsibilities\n\nBYU students are mission-driven individuals who routinely engage with big, life-shaping decisions. This maturity, combined with their intellectual rigor and values-based foundation, equips them to think strategically—grappling with ambiguity, balancing tradeoffs, and solving complex problems.",

This mindset captures the kind of low-ego, high-capacity leader the Strategy program seeks to cultivate: driven, curious, collaborative, and unafraid of sometimes messy work.\nThe program is not the best fit for students who prefer highly scripted environments or are not comfortable navigating between big picture thinking and nitty gritty execution.",

Consultants serve as trusted advisors—analyzing problems, designing solutions, and supporting implementation to drive organizational success.\nBYU students who have served missions are uniquely prepared for a consulting because of several key characteristics shared between consulting and missionary service:\n\nWorking with senior leaders – Consultants often collaborate with senior clients, much like missionaries engage with ward councils composed of seasoned Church members and leaders.\nClose knit team collaboration – Consultants typically work in small teams, building strong bonds and spending significant time together, similar to the companionship dynamic on a mission.\nProject-based structure – Consulting projects often last six weeks to six months before transitioning to a new client or project which mirrors how missionaries rotate through different areas.\n\nThe ability to quickly build trust and rapport with a broad range of stakeholders is an essential skill for success in both missions and consulting.\nThe work hours and lifestyle of a consultant can vary widely, depending on the firm and the project. While there are certainly quieter moments, in general it is considered a rigorous and intense profession. McKinsey is famous for using the phrase that working there is “more than a job but less than a life.” That being said, many Latter-day Saints have successful careers in consulting and are able to set appropriate boundaries to thrive professionally, in their families, and in church service.\nRelatively high turnover is common in the field of consulting with many new graduates spending 2 to 3 years working then pursuing an MBA, return to their consulting firm for two additional years and then exit to a corporate strategy type role.\nOthers exit directly after 2 to 3 years into other great corporate jobs or start their own companies.\nWorking in consulting has been compared to doing a medical residency. It can be a period of intensity in your career but lead to great future opportunities.\nThe BYU Stategy program has of one of the best consulting preparation curriculums anywhere in the country. Several of our faculty have worked as management consultants and infuse this experience throughout the program and the curriculum.\nThrough a partnership with Management Consulted we are pleased to offer our students access to the industry’s premier consulting preparation knowledge base and platform.\nExplore Management Consulting Job Board",

Answering a case question is a type of simulation that explores how you would think through a real business problem.

It’s less about getting the “exact right answer” and more about demonstrating your approach to solving complex, ambiguous problems like those faced in real life business situations.\nYou are strongly encouraged to practice several case questions before you complete your actual case interview.\nBelow you will find two types of case questions both of which will be valuable to practice. The first two are past case questions from strategy admissions and the remainder are example cases from McKinsey and Company.\n2023 case qustion and solution\n2024 case qustion and solution\nThe McKinsey cases are designed for 20 to 30 minute interviews so will be more involved than what you will have to answer in your application.

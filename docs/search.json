    "text": "Introduction\nThis guide is intended as an information resource for prospective and current students as well as employers and others interested in learning about the Strategic Management major at BYU.\nThe Strategic Management program at BYU helps students develop the skills needed to improve organizational performance by solving complex business problems and capitalizing on new opportunities. Doing so requires both hard technical skills (e.g. coding, data analysis, financial modeling) and soft people skills (e.g. influencing others through storytelling, developing trust, and working in teams).\nBecause of the necessity for both hard and soft skills the Strategy program seeks to attract students with high leadership potential who practice genuine curiosity, work well with others, are analytically rigorous, and driven.",

    "text": "What we look for in applicants\nA metaphor for the kind of student that will thrive in the Strategy program is that of a CEO-Janitor.\nThe CEO-Janitor is someone who takes ownership like a CEO by solving hard problems, making strategic decisions, and leading with vision but is also willing to roll up their sleeves like a janitor to do whatever the team needs, no task too small or beneath them. This mindset captures the kind of low-ego, high-capacity leader the Strategy program seeks to cultivate: driven, curious, collaborative, and unafraid of sometimes messy work.\nThe program is not the best fit for students who prefer highly scripted environments or are not comfortable navigating between big picture thinking and nitty gritty execution.",

Answering a case question is a type of simulation that explores how you would think through a real business problem. You’re asked to analyze a business situation, structure your thinking, and recommend a course of action. It tests how you break down complex problems, use data, and communicate solutions clearly and logically while under a bit of time pressure. It’s less about getting the “exact right answer” and more about demonstrating your approach to solving complex, ambiguous problems like those faced in real life business situations.\nYou are strongly encouraged to practice several case questions before you complete your actual case interview.\nBelow you will find two types of case questions both of which will be valuable to practice. The first two are past case questions from strategy admissions and the remainder are example cases from McKinsey and Company.\n2023 case qustion and solution\n2024 case qustion and solution\nThe McKinsey cases are designed for 20 to 30 minute interviews so will be more involved than what you will have to answer in your application.

## Mentorship Opportunities in the Strategy Program {.unnumbered}

Mentorship is a core part of the BYU Strategy experience. We’ve built a multi-layered mentorship ecosystem that connects students with peers, alumni, faculty, and professional advisors. These relationships are designed to support your growth—academically, professionally, and personally—from your first semester through graduation and beyond.

Below is an overview of the key mentorship opportunities available to you:

### Peer Mentorship: Seniors Mentoring Juniors {.unnumbered}

Each junior in the Strategy program is paired with a senior mentor. These mentors provide personalized guidance on course selection, recruiting timelines, case prep, and navigating the culture of the program. Their recent experience makes them approachable, practical, and invaluable resources.

### Strategy Club Presidencies {.unnumbered}

The Strategy Club Presidency is composed of experienced student leaders who oversee program-wide initiatives, events, and communications. In addition to their leadership roles, members of the presidency serve as informal mentors and connectors, helping students plug into opportunities, alumni networks, and faculty support. Students are encouraged to build relationships with presidency members throughout the year.

### Alumni Mentorship via BYU Connect {.unnumbered}

Thousands of BYU alumni and many Strategy alumni are available for mentoring through [BYU Connect](https://connect.byu.edu). This platform allows you to search for mentors by industry, company, or location. Alumni are generally very responsive and happy to help with career conversations, mock interviews, resume feedback, and more.

### Alumni Mentors Outside BYU Connect {.unnumbered}

Some of our most involved alumni aren’t active on BYU Connect but remain closely connected to the program through faculty and club relationships. These professionals are willing to mentor students when matched through faculty or student introductions.

### Business Career Center (BCC) {.unnumbered}

The Business Career Center offers personalized career guidance. Services include resume reviews, mock interviews, application strategy, and access to employer networks. Students are strongly encouraged to meet with the BCC advisors early and often.

The Marriott School Advisement Center supports your academic planning throughout your time in the Strategy program. Advisors can help with course sequencing, graduation planning, second majors or minors, and managing internship timelines.

### Leland Coaching Partnership {.unnumbered}

The Strategy program maintains a partnership with **Leland**, a coaching platform that connects students with experienced coaches, many of whom are former consultants, product managers, or graduate school admittees. Strategy student who recieve an interview offer from a top company for which Leland has a coach are provided with a 45 minute mock interview/coaching session with an employee or alumni from the target company. This is a unique student benefit, currently only offered by the Strategy program.

### Faculty Mentorship {.unnumbered}

Faculty in the Strategy program are highly accessible and committed to student mentorship. Whether you’re interested in research, considering graduate school, or exploring a specialized career path, faculty are available for one-on-one conversations and strategic guidance. These relationships often last well beyond your time at BYU.

## Your Network Starts Now {.unnumbered}

The mentorship resources in the Strategy program are here to help you grow and succeed but it’s up to you to engage. Reach out, ask questions, and take initiative. The connections you build here can shape your path for years to come.

As you seek mentorship, remember that these opportunities are built on generosity and mutual respect. Be thoughtful in how you ask for time, come prepared with specific questions, and follow up with gratitude. Don’t be a passive consumer of advice, be an engaged learner and a giver yourself.
